Brief introduction：
Gobang is a strategic board game that originated in China more than 2,000 years ago. The game is played on a grid of 19x19 cells, where two players take turns placing their pieces on the board, with the goal of creating a continuous line of five pieces of the same color. The game is simple to learn but difficult to master, and it has been enjoyed by players of all ages and skill levels around the world.
