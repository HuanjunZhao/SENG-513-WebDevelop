Brief introduction： <br>
Gobang is a strategic board game that originated in China more than 2,000 years ago. The game is played on a grid of 19x19 cells<br>
where two players take turns placing their pieces on the board, with the goal of creating a continuous line of five pieces of the same <br>
color. The game is simple to learn but difficult to master, and it has been enjoyed by players of all ages and skill levels around the world.<br>

Technologies Used:<br>
We use Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create the base style of the webpage and game logic, server, and client connection. <br>
We use the express API to build the server-side applications. We use the socket.io API to build real-time communication with different players and chat. <br>
We use node.js to allow the developer to run javascript on the server side. We use the JSON file to store data from the client. "<br>
